# GitHub Explorer
A homework for BlackSwan by √Åkos Hancz.

This site uses AngularJS to demonstrate my skills about the framework.

## How to run it

1. Checkout from this repository

1. Run `npm install` (install npm globally if you don't use it yet)

1. Run `bower install` to install dependencies

1. Run `gulp server` to create a local server for development with livereload.
The server can be accessed at the URL shown in the webconsole.
The local development build creates a .tmp folder and builds the content there.
